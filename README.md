# depth-first-search
scc03 builds a list of IntVecs (vertices connected by vectors). It prints out a list of the connected vertices, a matrix of edges, and a matrix of the Depth First Search on the list. It does the same thing after transposing the list. The Depth First Search looks for Strongly Connected Components, and takes place in findSccs().
Input should look like:
Number of vectors
VertexA VertexB
VertexC VertexD
...
